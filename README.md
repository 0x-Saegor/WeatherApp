# WeatherApp 🌤️

A complete weather application with React Native frontend and Go backend.

## Quick Start

This project has two main components:

1. **React Native App** (in `/WeatherApp` directory) - The mobile interface
2. **Go Backend** (in `/backend` directory) - API server

**👉 See the complete setup guide in [WeatherApp/README.md](./WeatherApp/README.md)**

## Architecture

```
├── WeatherApp/     # React Native + Expo frontend
└── backend/        # Go + Gin backend server
```

The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch weather data from WeatherAPI.
